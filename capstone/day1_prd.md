| **Version** | 1.0 |
| **Last Updated** | 7/31/2025 |

## 1. Executive Summary & Vision
The Inventory Management System (IMS) is designed to help businesses efficiently track and manage stock across multiple locations. By implementing real-time data tracking, automated stock alerts, and comprehensive reporting, the IMS aims to reduce errors, improve operational efficiency, and ensure that businesses always have the right products at the right time.

## 2. The Problem

**2.1. Problem Statement:**
Businesses currently face fragmented inventory management processes, leading to stock discrepancies, overstocking or understocking, and inefficient warehouse operations that result in decreased productivity and increased operational costs.

**2.2. User Personas & Scenarios:**

**Persona 1: Sarah, the Warehouse Worker**

Sarah struggles with manual inventory tracking, often leading to data entry errors and time-consuming processes when receiving and shipping items.

**Persona 2: Michael, the Inventory Manager**

Michael lacks real-time visibility into stock levels across multiple locations, making it difficult to make informed decisions about reordering and stock allocation.

**Persona 3: John, the Procurement Officer**

John is often caught off-guard by stockouts and relies on manual processes to track supplier performance and place orders, leading to supply chain disruptions.

## 3. Goals & Success Metrics

| Goal | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) | Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Ensure Inventory Accuracy | Reduce stock discrepancies | Maintain less than 2% inventory discrepancy rate |
| Improve Order Fulfillment | On-time delivery performance | Achieve 95% on-time deliveries |
| Optimize Stock Management | Reduce excess inventory | Decrease carrying costs by 15% in Q1 |
| Automate Manual Processes | Reduce manual data entry | Automate 60% of inventory tracking tasks |

## 4. Functional Requirements & User Stories

**Epic: Real-Time Stock Tracking**

**Story 1:** As a warehouse worker, I want to scan items as they enter the warehouse, so that stock levels are updated in real-time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I scan an item barcode, When the scan is successful, Then the system should automatically update the stock count and timestamp the entry.
- Given I scan a duplicate item, When the system detects it, Then it should increment the quantity rather than create a new entry.

**Story 2:** As an inventory manager, I want to view a dashboard of current stock levels across all locations, so that I can make informed decisions about reordering and stock allocation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am an inventory manager, When I access the dashboard, Then I should see real-time data on stock levels, low stock alerts, and trending items.
- Given I need location-specific data, When I filter by warehouse, Then I should see stock levels for that specific location only.

**Story 3:** As a procurement officer, I want automated reorder alerts, so that I don't run out of critical items.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a product falls below the reorder threshold, When the system detects this, Then I should receive an automated notification with recommended order quantity.
- Given I receive a reorder alert, When I review it, Then I should see supplier information and lead times.

**Story 4:** As a warehouse worker, I want to log items that are damaged or expired, so that I can update stock records and avoid incorrect reporting.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I identify a damaged or expired item, When I scan it and mark its status, Then the system should remove it from available inventory and log the reason.
- Given I process damaged goods, When I complete the entry, Then the system should generate a report for accounting purposes.

**Story 5:** As an inventory manager, I want to generate reports on stock movements, so that I can analyze trends and make data-driven decisions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I need a stock movement report, When I select a time period and location, Then the system should generate a detailed report with inbound, outbound, and adjustment transactions.
- Given I want to analyze trends, When I view the report, Then it should include charts showing stock level changes over time.

**Story 6:** As a warehouse worker, I want to process outbound shipments efficiently, so that I can ensure accurate order fulfillment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I have a pick list, When I scan items for shipment, Then the system should verify the items match the order and update stock levels.
- Given I complete a shipment, When I finalize it, Then the system should generate tracking information and notify relevant parties.

**Story 7:** As a procurement officer, I want to track supplier performance, so that I can make informed decisions about vendor relationships.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I need supplier metrics, When I access the supplier dashboard, Then I should see delivery performance, quality ratings, and pricing trends.
- Given a supplier consistently underperforms, When I review their metrics, Then I should be able to flag them for review or replacement.

**Story 8:** As an inventory manager, I want to set and manage reorder points, so that I can optimize stock levels for each item.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I need to set reorder parameters, When I access an item's details, Then I should be able to set minimum stock levels, reorder quantities, and lead times.
- Given seasonal demand changes, When I update reorder points, Then the system should apply the new thresholds immediately.

**Story 9:** As a warehouse worker, I want to perform cycle counts, so that I can maintain inventory accuracy.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I'm assigned a cycle count, When I access the count list, Then I should see items to count with their expected quantities.
- Given I find discrepancies during counting, When I report them, Then the system should flag them for investigation and adjustment.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

- **Performance:** The system must provide real-time inventory updates within 2 seconds of any transaction.
- **Security:** All data must be encrypted in transit and at rest. The system must support role-based access controls and audit trails.
- **Accessibility:** The user interface must be compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA standards and support mobile devices for warehouse operations.
- **Scalability:** The system must support multiple warehouses, up to 1 million SKUs, and 200 concurrent users during peak operations.
- **Reliability:** The system must maintain 99.5% uptime and include offline capability for critical warehouse operations.
