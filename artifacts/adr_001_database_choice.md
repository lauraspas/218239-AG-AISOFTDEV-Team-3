# Architectural Decision Record: Adoption of PostgreSQL with pgvector for Semantic Search in Inventory Management Tool

## Status
Accepted

---

## Context

The inventory management tool is being enhanced to support semantic search functionality, enabling users to find similar products and perform fuzzy matching using vector embeddings. The primary data store for the application is PostgreSQL, which provides ACID compliance, strong data consistency, and is already integrated into the operational stack.

The main architectural alternatives considered for implementing semantic search are:
1. Extending the existing PostgreSQL database with the `pgvector` extension to natively store and query vector embeddings.
2. Deploying a specialized vector database solution (such as ChromaDB or FAISS) alongside PostgreSQL, maintaining a separate service for high-performance vector search.

Key goals and constraints driving this decision include:
- **Data Integrity & Consistency**: Inventory records are mission-critical and require transactional safety.
- **Operational Simplicity**: The operations team prioritizes minimizing system sprawl and reducing integration/maintenance overhead.
- **Developer Productivity**: Leveraging existing team expertise and technology (SQL, PostgreSQL).
- **Workload Profile**: Anticipated vector search workloads are moderate in size and not expected to outgrow the capabilities of a vertically scaled PostgreSQL instance in the near term.
- **Cost**: Preference to minimize infrastructure and operational costs.

Stakeholders include engineering, operations, and product management.

## Decision

The decision is to use **PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension** to implement semantic search functionality within the inventory management tool.

**Justification:**
- **Single System Simplicity:** Using pgvector allows inventory and vector data to reside in the same database, simplifying data consistency, backup, and management processes.
- **Transactional Guarantees:** PostgreSQL provides full ACID compliance, ensuring strong consistency for both inventory and embedding dataâ€”critical for inventory use cases.
- **Familiar Query Interface:** Developers can use standard SQL for both transactional and semantic queries, reducing the learning curve and leveraging ORM support.
- **Operational Efficiency:** No need to deploy, operate, and monitor a separate specialized vector database, reducing operational complexity and risk.
- **Adequate Performance:** For the current and anticipated dataset size (small to medium), pgvector provides competitive query latency and performance.
- **Integration Ease:** As PostgreSQL is already the primary data store, extending it with pgvector is straightforward and requires minimal additional infrastructure.

Specialized vector databases (e.g., ChromaDB, FAISS) were considered but were deemed to introduce unnecessary complexity, integration overhead, and potential consistency challenges given current requirements. Their benefits in horizontal scalability and advanced vector search features are outweighed by the simplicity and safety of a single-system solution at this stage.

## Consequences

**Positive Consequences:**
- **Simplified Architecture:** Only one primary data platform to manage, monitor, and back up.
- **Strong Consistency:** Transactional integrity is maintained across both inventory and vector data.
- **Lower Integration Effort:** No need for data pipelines or sync mechanisms between transactional and vector stores.
- **Reduced Operational Cost:** Lower infrastructure and human resource costs due to fewer systems.
- **Developer Familiarity:** Existing team skills (SQL, PostgreSQL) are fully leveraged.

**Negative Consequences / Trade-offs:**
- **Performance Limits:** As dataset size or vector dimensionality grows substantially, pgvector may not match the query performance or scalability of specialized vector databases. Additional tuning or hardware scaling may be required.
- **Limited ANN Algorithms:** Fewer advanced approximate nearest neighbor search options compared to dedicated vector search engines.
- **Resource Contention:** Computationally heavy vector searches may impact transactional query performance if not carefully monitored and tuned.
- **Scaling Constraints:** Horizontal scaling for large vector search workloads is non-trivial with PostgreSQL.

**Follow-ups / Risks:**
- **Monitor Workload Growth:** Regularly assess performance as vector usage scales; re-evaluate architectural choice if semantic search becomes a primary, high-scale workload.
- **Performance Tuning:** Invest in query tuning and hardware scaling as needed.
- **Migration Path:** If requirements change, be prepared to revisit the use of a specialized vector database and plan a migration strategy.

**Cost Impact:**
- **Lower initial and ongoing cost** due to use of existing infrastructure and reduced operational burden.
- **Potential future costs** if migration to a dedicated vector database is required due to unanticipated scale or performance needs.
