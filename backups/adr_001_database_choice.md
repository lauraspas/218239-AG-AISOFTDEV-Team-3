# Architectural Decision Record: Use PostgreSQL with pgvector Extension for Semantic Search in New Hire Onboarding Tool

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The new hire onboarding tool requires semantic search capabilities to improve the discoverability and relevance of onboarding materials for users. The system must store both structured data (such as onboarding steps, user profiles, and completion tracking) and unstructured content (such as documents or knowledge base articles) in a way that supports efficient similarity search based on vector embeddings.

Several database options were evaluated:

- **PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension:** Allows storage of vector embeddings alongside structured data in a single, ACID-compliant relational database, leveraging existing SQL and operational expertise.
- **Specialized vector databases (e.g., ChromaDB, FAISS):** Provide advanced and highly performant vector search capabilities but require separate infrastructure, increased operational overhead, and more complex integration between structured and unstructured data.

Key constraints and requirements include:
- **Moderate scale:** The onboarding tool is expected to handle thousands to low millions of records, not internet-scale datasets.
- **Operational simplicity:** Minimize system complexity and leverage existing team expertise in PostgreSQL.
- **Unified data model:** Seamless integration between onboarding workflows (SQL/ORM) and semantic search.
- **Reliability:** Full transactional guarantees for structured data and content management.
- **Cost-effectiveness:** Avoid unnecessary infrastructure and operational costs.

A decision is needed to select the most appropriate database approach for the onboarding toolâ€™s semantic search feature, ensuring a balance between performance, maintainability, and total cost of ownership.

## Decision
We will use **PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension** to implement semantic search for the new hire onboarding tool.

**Justification:**
- **Unified data platform:** Storing both structured onboarding data and vector embeddings in PostgreSQL allows for simplified query logic, transactional consistency, and straightforward maintenance.
- **Operational efficiency:** The team already has PostgreSQL expertise and infrastructure, reducing the learning curve, setup time, and ongoing operational overhead.
- **Adequate performance:** For the anticipated onboarding dataset size (thousands to low millions of records), pgvector provides sufficiently fast similarity search (sub-millisecond to tens of milliseconds latency).
- **Scalability fit:** While not designed for massive, internet-scale vector workloads, PostgreSQL with pgvector can comfortably support our projected user base and content volume with appropriate tuning.
- **Cost-effective:** No need to provision, deploy, and operate a separate vector database system, avoiding additional infrastructure and maintenance expenses.
- **Ecosystem and support:** Benefits from PostgreSQL's mature tooling for backup, replication, monitoring, and security, ensuring high reliability and supportability.

Specialized vector databases were ruled out due to their higher operational complexity, data fragmentation risks, and unnecessary performance overhead for the current and foreseeable scale of the onboarding tool.

## Consequences
**Positive Effects:**
- **Simplicity:** Reduced system complexity by consolidating all onboarding data and vector search in a single database.
- **Maintainability:** Leverages existing team skills and standard PostgreSQL operational processes for deployment, monitoring, and backup.
- **Cost savings:** Avoids the need for additional infrastructure and associated operational costs.
- **Transactional safety:** Ensures ACID guarantees for onboarding workflows and content management.
- **Seamless integration:** Can use SQL and ORMs to query and join structured onboarding data with semantic search results.

**Negative Effects/Trade-offs:**
- **Performance limitations:** Vector search performance may degrade if usage or dataset size grows significantly beyond initial projections; may require tuning or re-evaluation if needs change.
- **Feature limitations:** Lacks some advanced vector search features (e.g., hybrid search, re-ranking) present in specialized vector databases.
- **Scalability ceiling:** Scaling to very large datasets or high-throughput, low-latency workloads would be complex and may eventually necessitate migration to a specialized solution.
- **Concurrency considerations:** Heavy semantic search operations could impact transactional workloads if not properly managed.

**Cost Implications:**
- **Short-term costs:** Minimal, as PostgreSQL infrastructure and expertise already exist.
- **Long-term costs:** May incur additional costs if future growth requires re-platforming to a specialized vector database, but current approach delays and potentially avoids this need.

Overall, this decision provides the right balance of simplicity, performance, reliability, and cost for the current scope and foreseeable growth of the new hire onboarding tool.
